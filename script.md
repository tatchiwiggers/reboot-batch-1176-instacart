We're going to take a little bit more time than the other ones, as there's three different parts to it, so that it's going to be basically modelling a simple store interface, going into a store, picking products off the shelves and ultimately going to the cashier and cashing in. The user can select which items they put in their shopping cart and, when done, check out and see the final bill. So what we're going to do is, as usual, we'll do some pseudo coding FIRST.

If you go into the exercise you'll see a basic pseudo code. We're going to extend that a little bit as well. So first step, always the dumb program. Dump shopping here. This is the first iteration here, so we basically have a welcome to the instacart. We display the stock that's inside of the store, so we banana mango, asparagus, so and so forth, and then finally we go ahead and we ask the user which item they want to buy.

PSEUDO CODE

# 1. welcome users to instacart
# 2. Define our store
# 3. create an empty cart for the user
# 4. List the available items with thei prices
# 5. Ask user which item they want to buy
# 6. save the answer
# 7. if the user wuits, we go to checkout
# 8. List items that have been purchased
# 9. calculate total price of our items and display it




HASH
Bread, cheese, whatever we're going to be having in our store here, all of those are still pieces of data. They're not identifiers. That's when you would use symbols, identifier which identifies data here. This is actually a piece of data, is the name of the product, so we want to actually put it as a string. We'll see later on examples of when you would use a symbol instead in this instacart lesson, but a little bit later on. But for now, use a string. Milk is data. Bread is data and that's why we're doing it as a string. So let's continue on. I'm going to go ahead and save bread.
